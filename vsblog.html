      <h2>Pasting same code below the line</h2>
      <p>
       There is lot of time wasted on copying the same type of code having similar syntax by right clicking on copying and then pasting it..Rather we can use shortcut key Alt + Shift +down arrow key for copying and pasting below the line .

        Vs code for react developers
      </h2>
      <p>
       For making functional component rather than typing the whole syntax we can easily type rfcae and react will make it the full fledged functional component with the file name.We can also download several extensions in vscode which can make our code writing process easier..also for preetifying the code we have manyt extensions in our app ..which can make our code  look beautiful and readable.
